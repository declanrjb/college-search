Overview,"This file contains the unduplicated headcount of students enrolled over the 12-month period (July 1, 2023 - June 30, 2024) for both undergraduate and graduate levels. Beginning with the 2019-20 data collected in 2020-21, undergraduate level headcounts were available by attendance status (full- and part-time) for both degree/certificate-seeking and nondegree/certificate-seeking students. Degree/certificate-seeking headcounts were further disaggregated by first-time, transfer-ins, and continuing student categories.  These enrollment data are particularly valuable for institutions that use non-traditional calendar systems and offer short-term programs. Because this enrollment measure encompasses an entire year, it provides a more complete picture of the number of students these schools serve.  Each record is uniquely defined by the variables IPEDS ID (UNITID), and the level and degree/certificate-seeking status of student (EFFYALEV). Each record will contain the total headcount for men and women, and the total headcount for men and women for all nine race/ethnicity categories. Beginning with 2021-22, variables containing information on students that do not fit the IPEDS binary gender (men/women) are available for total undergraduate and graduate levels.  In 2022-23 institutions were instructed to report these data if the reported value was 5 or more students. These data are not disaggregated by the detailed undergraduate categories or by attendance status.
